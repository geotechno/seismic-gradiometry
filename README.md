## Seismic Wavefield Reconstruction in the Presence of 6C Observations

In the past years considerable effort has been made into installing large seismic networks (like USArray, HiNet) allowing in principle to recover wavefield gradients (rotation, strain) by using array methods. Some call this as seismic gradiometry. One reason for doing this that is allows, in principle, to reconstruct the entire wavefield at any point inside the network and extract relevant wavefield properties (e.g., phase velocities, amplitudes, etc.). The development of rotation sensors and the investigation of waht one could do with these sensors matches this development of gradiometry. Rotation sensors at the surface directly measure gradient information. Therefore the situation to reconstruct the wavefield - if at each point 6 components (6C) of motion - might significantly improve. In fact, theory says that the minimum wavelength that can be reconstructed is half the Nyquist wavelength. In other words, along each dimension half the number of sensors would be sufficient to reconstruct the wavefield as accurate as with 3 components (3C) sensors. The goal of this research is to investigate the situation where 6C observations are available from a theoretical point of view using synthetic seismogram simulations. Time and data permitting within the project the analysis of real data from an active seismic experiment might also be possible.
